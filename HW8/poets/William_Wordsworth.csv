	Earth has not anything to show more fair:
	Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
	A sight so touching in its majesty:
	This City now doth, like a garment, wear
	The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,
	Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
	Open unto the fields, and to the sky;
	All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
	Never did sun more beautifully steep
	In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;
	Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
	The river glideth at his own sweet will:
	Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
	And all that mighty heart is lying still!     "
1,My Heart Leaps Up,my heart leaps up when behold rainbow in the sky so was it when my life began so is it now am man so be it when shall grow old or let me die the child is father of the man and wish my days to be bound each to each by natural piety,"My heart leaps up when I behold
A Rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began;
So is it now I am a man;
So be it when I shall grow old,
Or let me die!
The Child is father of the man;
And I wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.     "
2,The Solitary Reaper,behold her single in the field yon solitary highland lass reaping and singing by herself stop here or gently pass alone she cuts and binds the grain and sings melancholy strain listen for the vale profound is overflowing with the sound no nightingale did ever chaunt more welcome notes to weary bands of travellers in some shady haunt among arabian sands voice so thrilling never was heard in spring time from the cuckoo bird breaking the silence of the seas among the farthest hebrides will no one tell me what she sings perhaps the plaintive numbers flow for old unhappy far off things and battles long ago or is it some more humble lay familiar matter of to day some natural sorrow loss or pain that has been and may be again whate er the theme the maiden sang as if her song could have no ending saw her singing at her work and over the sickle bending listened motionless and still and as mounted up the hill the music in my heart bore long after it was heard no more,"     Behold her, single in the field,
     Yon solitary Highland Lass!
     Reaping and singing by herself;
     Stop here, or gently pass!
     Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
     And sings a melancholy strain;
     O listen! for the Vale profound
     Is overflowing with the sound.
     No Nightingale did ever chaunt
     More welcome notes to weary bands
     Of travellers in some shady haunt,
     Among Arabian sands:
     A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
     In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,
     Breaking the silence of the seas
     Among the farthest Hebrides.
     Will no one tell me what she sings?—
     Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
     For old, unhappy, far-off things,
     And battles long ago:
     Or is it some more humble lay,
     Familiar matter of to-day?
     Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,
     That has been, and may be again?
     Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang
     As if her song could have no ending;
     I saw her singing at her work,
     And o'er the sickle bending;—
     I listened, motionless and still;
     And, as I mounted up the hill,
     The music in my heart I bore,
     Long after it was heard no more.     "

And when I cross'd the Wild,
I chanc'd to see at break of day
The solitary Child.

No Mate, no comrade Lucy knew;
She dwelt on a wild Moor,
The sweetest Thing that ever grew
Beside a human door!

You yet may spy the Fawn at play,
The Hare upon the Green;
But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
Will never more be seen.

""To-night will be a stormy night,
You to the Town must go,
And take a lantern, Child, to light
Your Mother thro' the snow.""

""That, Father! will I gladly do;
'Tis scarcely afternoon—
The Minster-clock has just struck two,
And yonder is the Moon.""

At this the Father rais'd his hook
And snapp'd a faggot-band;
He plied his work, and Lucy took
The lantern in her hand.

Not blither is the mountain roe,
With many a wanton stroke
Her feet disperse, the powd'ry snow
That rises up like smoke.

The storm came on before its time,
She wander'd up and down,
And many a hill did Lucy climb
But never reach'd the Town.

The wretched Parents all that night
Went shouting far and wide;
But there was neither sound nor sight
To serve them for a guide.

At day-break on a hill they stood
That overlook'd the Moor;
And thence they saw the Bridge of Wood
A furlong from their door.

And now they homeward turn'd, and cry'd
""In Heaven we all shall meet!""
When in the snow the Mother spied
The print of Lucy's feet.

Then downward from the steep hill's edge
They track'd the footmarks small;
And through the broken hawthorn-hedge,
And by the long stone-wall;

And then an open field they cross'd,
The marks were still the same;
They track'd them on, nor ever lost,
And to the Bridge they came.

They follow'd from the snowy bank
The footmarks, one by one,
Into the middle of the plank,
And further there were none.

Yet some maintain that to this day
She is a living Child,
That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
Upon the lonesome Wild.

O'er rough and smooth she trips along,
And never looks behind;
And sings a solitary song
That whistles in the wind.

Sometimes titled ' Solitude ',
Lucy Gray is based on a true event, but Wordsworth strayed from the true account in that in his poem her body was never. found
He wrote
Written at Goslar in Germany. It was founded on a circumstance told me by my Sister, of a little girl who, not far from Halifax in Yorkshire, was bewildered in a snow-storm. Her footsteps were traced by her parents to the middle of the lock of a canal, and no other vestige of her, backward or forward, could be traced. The body however was found in the canal. The way in which the incident was treated and the spiritualising of the character might furnish hints for contrasting the imaginative influences which I have endeavoured to throw over common life with Crabbe's matter of fact style of treating subjects of the same kind. This is not spoken to his disparagement, far from it, but to direct the attention of thoughtful readers, into whose hands these notes may fall, to a comparison that may both enlarge the circle of their sensibilities, and tend to produce in them a catholic judgment.

4,Daffodils,wandered lonely as cloud that floats on high over vales and hills when all at once saw crowd host of golden daffodils beside the lake beneath the trees fluttering and dancing in the breeze continuous as the stars that shine and twinkle on the milky way they stretched in never ending line along the margin of bay ten thousand saw at glance tossing their heads in sprightly dance the waves beside them danced but they outdid the sparkling waves in glee poet could not but be gay in such jocund company gazed—and gazed—but little thought what wealth the show to me had brought for oft when on my couch lie in vacant or in pensive mood they flash upon that inward eye which is the bliss of solitude and then my heart with pleasure fills and dances with the daffodils,"I wandered lonely as a cloud
  That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
  A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
  And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
  Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
  Outdid the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
  In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
  In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
  Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills, 
And dances with the daffodils.     "

     I had no human fears:
She seemed a thing that could not feel
     The touch of earthly years.
No motion has she now, no force;
     She neither hears nor sees;
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course,
     With rocks, and stones, and trees.Composed whilst on his travels in in Germany. 
Coleridge wrote of this poem in a letter of April 1799: ""Some months ago Wordsworth transmitted to me a most sublime Epitaph ... whether it had any reality, I cannot say.--Most probably, in some gloomier moment he had fancied the moment in which his Sister might die.""     "
6,We Are Seven,—a simple child that lightly draws its breath and feels its life in every limb what should it know of death met little cottage girl she was eight years old she said her hair was thick with many curl that clustered round her head she had rustic woodland air and she was wildly clad her eyes were fair and very fair —her beauty made me glad sisters and brothers little maid how many may you be how many seven in all she said and wondering looked at me and where are they pray you tell she answered seven are we and two of us at conway dwell and two are gone to sea two of us in the churchyard lie my sister and my brother and in the churchyard cottage dwell near them with my mother you say that two at conway dwell and two are gone to sea yet ye are seven pray you tell sweet maid how this may be then did the little maid reply seven boys and girls are we two of us in the churchyard lie beneath the churchyard tree you run about my little maid your limbs they are alive if two are in the churchyard laid then ye are only five their graves are green they may be seen the little maid replied twelve steps or more from my mother door and they are side by side my stockings there often knit my kerchief there hem and there upon the ground sit and sing song to them and often after sunset sir when it is light and fair take my little porringer and eat my supper there the first that died was sister jane in bed she moaning lay till god released her of her pain and then she went away so in the churchyard she was laid and when the grass was dry together round her grave we played my brother john and and when the ground was white with snow and could run and slide my brother john was forced to go and he lies by her side how many are you then said if they two are in heaven quick was the little maid reply master we are seven but they are dead those two are dead their spirits are in heaven was throwing words away for still the little maid would have her will and say nay we are seven,"—A simple child, 
That lightly draws its breath, 
And feels its life in every limb, 
What should it know of death?

I met a little cottage girl: 
She was eight years old, she said; 
Her hair was thick with many a curl 
That clustered round her head.

She had a rustic, woodland air, 
And she was wildly clad; 
Her eyes were fair, and very fair; 
—Her beauty made me glad.

""Sisters and brothers, little maid, 
How many may you be?"" 
""How many? Seven in all,"" she said, 
And wondering looked at me.

""And where are they? I pray you tell."" 
She answered, ""Seven are we; 
And two of us at Conway dwell, 
And two are gone to sea.

""Two of us in the churchyard lie, 
My sister and my brother; 
And in the churchyard cottage, I 
Dwell near them with my mother.""

""You say that two at Conway dwell, 
And two are gone to sea, 
Yet ye are seven! — I pray you tell, 
Sweet maid, how this may be.""

Then did the little maid reply, 
""Seven boys and girls are we; 
Two of us in the churchyard lie, 
Beneath the churchyard tree.""

""You run about, my little maid, 
Your limbs they are alive; 
If two are in the churchyard laid, 
Then ye are only five.""

""Their graves are green, they may be seen,"" 
The little maid replied, 
""Twelve steps or more from my mother's door, 
And they are side by side.

""My stockings there I often knit, 
My kerchief there I hem; 
And there upon the ground I sit, 
And sing a song to them.

""And often after sunset, sir, 
When it is light and fair, 
I take my little porringer, 
And eat my supper there.

""The first that died was sister Jane; 
In bed she moaning lay, 
Till God released her of her pain; 
And then she went away.

""So in the churchyard she was laid; 
And, when the grass was dry, 
Together round her grave we played, 
My brother John and I.

""And when the ground was white with snow, 
And I could run and slide, 
My brother John was forced to go, 
And he lies by her side.""

""How many are you, then,"" said I, 
""If they two are in heaven?"" 
Quick was the little maid's reply, 
""O master! we are seven.""

""But they are dead; those two are dead! 
Their spirits are in heaven!"" 
'T was throwing words away; for still 
The little maid would have her will, 
And say, ""Nay, we are seven!""     "
7,There Was A Boy,there was boy ye knew him well ye cliffs and islands of winander many time at evening when the earliest stars began to move along the edges of the hills rising or setting would he stand alone beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake and there with fingers interwoven both hands pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth uplifted he as through an instrument blew mimic hootings to the silent owls that they might answer him —and they would shout across the watery vale and shout again responsive to his call —with quivering peals and long halloos and screams and echoes loud redoubled and redoubled concourse wild of jocund din and when there came pause of silence such as baffled his best skill then sometimes in that silence while he hung listening gentle shock of mild surprise has carried far into his heart the voice of mountain torrents or the visible scene would enter unawares into his mind with all its solemn imagery its rocks its woods and that uncertain heaven received into the bosom of the steady lake this boy was taken from his mates and died in childhood ere he was full twelve years old pre eminent in beauty is the vale where he was born and bred the churchyard hangs upon slope above the village school and through that churchyard when my way has led on summer evenings believe that there long half hour together have stood mute —looking at the grave in which he lies later incorporated in the prelude 364 97 composed in germany in november 1798 in the earliest manuscript november 1798 the poem or reminiscence ends with line 25 there is no reference to death and the remembered boy who mimicked the owls was the poet himself winander windermere the largest of the english lakes in westmorland and lancashire 28 the vale of esthwaite with its village of hawkshead the school which wordsworth attended and the nearby churchyard as here described the schoolmate whose grave was in the churchyard was probably john vickers who died in 1782 when wordsworth was twelve,"There was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs 
And islands of Winander! many a time,
At evening, when the earliest stars began
To move along the edges of the hills,
Rising or setting, would he stand alone,
Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake;
And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands
Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth
Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,
Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls
That they might answer him.—And they would shout
Across the watery vale, and shout again,
Responsive to his call,—with quivering peals,
And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud
Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild
Of jocund din! And, when there came a pause
Of silence such as baffled his best skill:
Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung
Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise
Has carried far into his heart the voice
Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene
Would enter unawares into his mind
With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,
Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received
Into the bosom of the steady lake.

This boy was taken from his mates, and died
In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.
Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale
Where he was born and bred: the churchyard hangs
Upon a slope above the village-school;
And through that churchyard when my way has led
On summer-evenings, I believe that there
A long half-hour together I have stood
Mute —looking at the grave in which he lies!1.
 Later incorporated in The Prelude, V, 364-97. Composed in Germany in November, 1798. In the earliest manuscript (Nov. 1798), the poem or reminiscence ends with line 25; there is no reference to death, and the remembered boy who mimicked the owls was the poet himself.
2. 
Winander: Windermere, the largest of the English lakes, in Westmorland and Lancashire.
28. 
The vale of Esthwaite with its village of Hawkshead, the school which Wordsworth attended, and the nearby churchyard as here described. The schoolmate whose grave was in the churchyard was probably John Vickers who died in 1782, when Wordsworth was twelve.     "
8,Lines Written In Early Spring,heard thousand blended notes while in grove sate reclined in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts bring sad thoughts to the mind to her fair works did nature link the human soul that through me ran and much it grieved my heart to think what man has made of man through primrose tufts in that green bower the periwinkle trailed its wreaths and it is my faith that every flower enjoys the air it breathes the birds around me hopped and played their thoughts cannot measure but the least motion which they made it seemed thrill of pleasure the budding twigs spread out their fan to catch the breezy air and must think do all can that there was pleasure there if this belief from heaven be sent if such be nature holy plan have not reason to lament what man has made of man,"I HEARD a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:—-
But the least motion which they made,
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?     "

Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
Little we see in Nature that is ours;
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
The winds that will be howling at all hours,
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;
For this, for everything, we are out of tune,
It moves us not.—Great God! I'd rather be
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
     Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
     Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.     "
