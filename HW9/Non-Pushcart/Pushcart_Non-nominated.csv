2023,Lexi Pelle,DIET COKE,"All I saw my mother drink 
for years. In the diner, served 
with a striped straw and shredded
paper beanie or sometimes 
at Stop & Shop just before checkout, 
its perfect plastic body pulled from 
the squat fridge that sits underneath 
the conveyor belt—but most often 
sipped from a silver can on the porch. 
She never asked for ice. Never dared 
to dilute the fizzy pollution of artificial 
sweeteners. The first time I tried it 
I thought it tasted like a backhanded 
compliment, surprisingly good, 
the dark dizzying lake like a cactus 
burped Splenda into my mouth. 
The flavor so far from milk or juice, 
like a fresh-squeezed robot, a supermodel’s 
saliva. My sister and I sat around her 
like the students of Socrates and watched her 
succumb to the only sweetness she ever allowed
herself. A true mother, listening 
to the questions it spat into the air,
voice lifted at the end of every swallowed
sentence. Let’s play the quiet game? 
she suggested on long car trips
to Hershey or to one of Kate’s soccer 
tournaments and only then could we all hear it
whisper to her from the cup holder
as a speed bump puddled the lid
and she brought the spill to her lips. "
2022,Nianxi Chen,JUNE IS ALMOST DONE,"June is almost done. In all of June,
I didn’t finish a single thing.
Father is in bed,
smaller and smaller, day by day.
The time left to him by the world
isn’t much.
And how much is left to me?
I visit him three times per day,
nothing more than ten steps looking at five.
The south-facing window is always open.
Father crafted the wood lattice when he was a young man.
Last night, he awoke from a coma,
suddenly told Mother: When I’m gone,
bury me with my carpenter ax.
June is almost done. Cornstalks in the field
are as tall as a man.
The empty mountain is filled with cicada sounds.
Only newcomers comfort the leave-takers.
Only time receives the world’s enlightenment."
2021,Danusha Laméris,APPOINTMENT,"I’m leaned back on the table, the nurse strapping 
a band around my bicep, when she says,
So, your son must be thirteen by now. No, I say 
he’s dead, which isn’t how I mean to say it.
Oh! she says, your chart. Yes, I say. His birth,
the year. And now she feels bad. I’m sorry, she says,
I’m so sorry. It’s OK, I tell her, but the reading is too high,
the pressure. We’ll try and do it again, she says.
Again. Again. The times I step back into the story,
and in this story my son is still living inside
me, he’s aquatic. I am the fish bowl and he is
the fish. I imagine his bones, his lungs, the small
perfect heart. And also, his hands, his feet. 
A body growing inside another body. So precise.
And then he’s on the outside and it doesn’t work:
The air. Gravity. I want to apologize. He can’t breathe
right, he keeps convulsing, the electric
surge ticking his head to the left, the left, his
lip curled in disgust, but no, he looks more afraid—
some terror coming towards him. Not blue, not blue, 
I tell myself the times it happens and he isn’t. 
The doctor says, the bad kind of blue is cobalt, smurf blue. 
Dusky is not the worst kind. But how does she know 
on a baby this shade of brown? Does she? 
I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I tell him in the hospital again 
but he can’t hear me because the sedative and the new doctor
is asking me can a student insert a long needle 
into his spinal column, would that be OK?
I look out the window and there’s plants, a garden.
Our nurse comes in, says, There’s another garden
on the roof. You can go look. Just don’t jump off.
The story is a circle that repeats, a round,
the voices overlapping. He’s in my arms again
my baby, my baby, I am singing to him.
I kiss his cheek, his hair. And now he’s not thirteen. 
He’s not anything. The nurse has left and I’m alone.
On the ceiling is a lake, a field of flowers.
Let’s try this again, I say to no one. Can you see me?
I’m still here. I’m lying on the table, looking up."
2021,Jinendra Jain,THOSE DAYS,"You can take all the rusting gold I secreted away,
for those monsoons until childhood slipped away;
those petrichor smells, flooded lanes,
and paper-boats that floated away;
those long power-cuts, roof-top cots,
and sultry summer nights chatted away;
those last-row wooden-benches we fought for,
and the whispers when teachers looked away;
those childhood vows of togetherness, JJ,
and the smiling faces that have faded away."
2022,Ting Li,A LITTLE FLOWER,"A little flower doesn’t know how beautiful she is 
She has no such a concept
A little flower doesn’t even know her own name
Not to mention the meaning
On the side of the road
A little flower never feels lonely
She blooms as if she doesn’t know she will wither
She withers as if she doesn’t know what is wither
She just quietly blooms, blooms
Like a ring that is just the right size
Worn on the knuckle of God"
2023,Karan Kapoor,PORTRAIT OF THE FATHER AS AN ALCOHOLIC,"The first thing I notice about him
is the expression on his face baring
his sobriety is a bubble one can pop
with a blow. He is a unicorn—a horse
of addiction with a horn of dedication
to quit. The days he chooses not to drink
flake off his shoulders like cracked paint.
By the time he was my age, he’d burned
alcohol into his skin. He’s not guilty
of all he’s accused, but still guilty
of so much else. Why should I draw
his portrait in third-person when I
can in second- which is to say why
should I paint you in blue when I can
in sky? For decades, you have smelled
like areca nut and slaked lime.
We have amassed wrinkles begging
you give up. Ma doubts you
will die a delighted man. As do I.
As do you. Diamond wounds
diamond, you say. Why does water
not wash away water? Poison remedies
poison, why does wind not blow away
wind? The despair of not raising a glass
to despair is an essential precondition
of despair which echoes higher
than cheer that comes by confessing
cheers. Long after you, we will boast
bruises on our chest to show you
were here. Now we bathe
stone in milk, bury a sitar
in a tree for the wind to strum,
praying the music will urge you
to seek help. You’re God,
you sing."
2023,Pella Winkopp,UNDERWATER LAKES,"there is a stillness in me that refuses to be translated,
oceans within oceans; my halcyon halocline unmoving,
stiffened by my own salty breath.
do you hear it now?
the symphony of tiny footsteps beneath my chest,
the swallowing of rivers,
damp droughts swirling into cyclones;
a paradox of movement.
i am nothing but everything i failed to become,
a quiet idealization of my worst dreams;
the bread knives in my mind chafing
against the hard meat of ambition; destroying entirely
anything yet too soft to call itself purpose.
these are the brine pools of the wilted,
us unlucky, lethargic few burning warmer than the sun
without a cloth with which to catch.
i have nothing but the names they gave me,
dull now and hidden beneath the skin of my palms,
pickling in the slow sink of inertia."
2021,Srinivas Mandavilli,RAIN,"We lay together on a charpoy, the thrum on asbestos roofs ending all days. The downpour cantillates like Sanskrit chanting we had heard at Kamakhya temple, the one in the drenched valley of leechee and guava trees. As we gathered by Dikhow’s shore, the river gravid with mud, branches and massive trunks flowed with a ferocity towards a cantilever bridge. Brahmaputra becomes a sea every monsoon, never settling, inundating all the elephant grass which our mahout carefully holds back on our rides. Today we wander into another summer on Lakshman Jhula where the Ganges turns green, tourists run to small motels to escape the drizzle. Some things do not change—the small delight of sitting on a railway platform savoring chana dal fritters by wet train tracks with steaming cardamom tea in clay cups. There is a storm expected, already the smell of rain mouses its way in like the time you cried after your mother’s passing, the sky was splayed by Indra’s bow. There was so much dampness the night your water broke, as we ran from the laundromat with a newspaper over our heads, the car’s floor mats also soaked from a leaking heater core. And this is how I know you, on an outrigger listening to a whale song in a drizzle, breeze coursing on your face, not joyless but not joyous for anything and in its swells  
flood waters pour in a thought that the world might change 
once or not at all"
2022,Max Sessner,ONE DAY,"Everything comes back to haunt us
one day the boy you beat
up a long time ago
stands before you in the street car
he is like you now around
sixty his hair thin like
yours generally he looks 
like you moves like 
you as he approaches you
walks past gets off
at the next stop
that was it you turn
after him and note 
the stop and tomorrow
you will forget it"
2023,M,SALT,"In this room down a hall
at the Hopewell House
every Wednesday
from 6:30 to 8:00 p.m.,
the widowed have agreed to meet
to lick the salt block.
My name tag reads
Albino deer (recessive rarity): widow at 35.
Dun-colored Helen and Marie
mistake me for a sheep or a goat
as we draw our chairs into a circle
of circumstance. Muscles in their aged faces
twitch with greed and suspicion.
In the larger world,
Jean and I would sit in adjoining streetcar seats,
read our newspapers,
and never share a headline.
Even Doris, who drags the remains
of a personal god at the bottom
of her purse, tucked next to non-prescription
reading glasses she bought on sale at Walmart,
shrinks from my pink eyes.
Louise has ten grandchildren,
three she and Harry were raising
because her daughter is, well, you know,
she doesn’t want to say. She won’t tell you either
that when Harry up and died like that,
some small part of her wished
he’d had the decency to take those kids with him,
but he never even took them to the park.
Betty lost a husband and found
a lump. Elsie says when the ambulance
comes to the Ridgewood Nursing Home,
they don’t turn on the sirens
for fear they’ll incite a riot
of dying. Ida says yeah, she knows.
She’s lost two of them that way. I nod.
Judith’s raised eyebrow asks
What could one with hooves so pale know of loss?
A marriage must be long
to be 40 years deep,
and grief is a black market business
best kept to themselves. If I taste it,
others will want it.
Young bucks will be dying in droves.
In war, in the streets,
in flaming buildings.
Or quietly in a bed next to me at night.
That sting in the wound, that particular tang
on the tongue, are theirs.
Keep me away from the salt.
Their old ones are sanctified,
their sorrow is sacred,
denial alive in the hide."
