{"Year":2021,"Author":"Erik Trilk","Title":"DAZED AND CONFUSED","Poem":"It won't be long until I'm with the moonthis summer. Bare feet whisper on midnightgrass. Drenched dazed and confused afternoons soon.Flags furled high on the fourth. Ball caps slightly\nOff-balance. Out of order. Life shut down.Pebbles sprinkle high school bedrooms at night.\"I'll be right down,\" she smiles, fearful of sound.Hands entwined; fingers sweat. Teenage forthright.\nMidnight memories turn into dawningsuns. Iowa yawns her dawn's early sign.Small towns reveal their majestic awnings.Morning tiptoes through tall beams of sunshine.\nA girl kisses a boy. Lips stay disposed,smiling... until eyes are no longer closed.","Poem_for_model":"it will not be long until am with the moonthis summer bare feet whisper on midnightgrass drenched dazed and confused afternoons soon flags furled high on the fourth ball caps slightly off balance out of order life shut down pebbles sprinkle high school bedrooms at night will be right down she smiles fearful of sound hands entwined fingers sweat teenage forthright midnight memories turn into dawningsuns iowa yawns her dawn early sign small towns reveal their majestic awnings morning tiptoes through tall beams of sunshine girl kisses boy lips stay disposed smiling until eyes are no longer closed","POS":[[["long","RB"]],[["moonthis","NN"]],[["summer","NN"]],[["bare","NN"]],[["foot","NN"]],[["whisper","NN"]],[["midnightgrass","NN"]],[["drenched","VBN"]],[["dazed","VBN"]],[["confused","VBN"]],[["afternoon","NN"]],[["soon","RB"]],[["flag","NN"]],[["furled","VBN"]],[["high","JJ"]],[["fourth","JJ"]],[["ball","NN"]],[["cap","NN"]],[["slightly","RB"]],[["balance","NN"]],[["order","NN"]],[["life","NN"]],[["shut","NN"]],[["pebble","JJ"]],[["sprinkle","NN"]],[["high","JJ"]],[["school","NN"]],[["bedroom","NN"]],[["night","NN"]],[["right","NN"]],[["smile","NN"]],[["fearful","NN"]],[["sound","NN"]],[["hand","NN"]],[["entwined","VBN"]],[["finger","NN"]],[["sweat","NN"]],[["teenage","NN"]],[["forthright","NN"]],[["midnight","NN"]],[["memory","NN"]],[["turn","NN"]],[["dawningsuns","NNS"]],[["iowa","NN"]],[["yawn","NN"]],[["dawn","NN"]],[["early","RB"]],[["sign","NN"]],[["small","JJ"]],[["town","NN"]],[["reveal","NN"]],[["majestic","JJ"]],[["awning","VBG"]],[["morning","NN"]],[["tiptoe","NN"]],[["tall","NN"]],[["beam","NN"]],[["sunshine","NN"]],[["girl","NN"]],[["kiss","NN"]],[["boy","NN"]],[["lip","NN"]],[["stay","NN"]],[["disposed","VBN"]],[["smiling","VBG"]],[["eye","NN"]],[["longer","NN"]],[["closed","VBD"]]],"dist_pos":{"RB":4,"NN":48,"VBN":6,"JJ":6,"NNS":1,"VBG":2,"VBD":1},"doc_term_matrix":4,"sentiment":{"neg":0.084,"neu":0.804,"pos":0.113,"compound":0.6369}}
